**Project: Microwave Program for Sandwiches**

We are making a program that tells how tasty a melted cheese sandwich from the microwave is. The taste gets better for 100 seconds, reaching 100 points, and stays good for two minutes. After two minutes, the sandwich becomes not tasty. The program asks for the time in the microwave and shows the taste points.
